				What is Diabetes?
				</h3>
				<p>
					The term Diabetes comes from the Greek word for ‘siphon’, as people with diabetes 

					urinate frequently. Diabetes Mellitus is also derived from a Greek word, meaning ‘sweet’, 

					a reference to the presence of sugar in the urine. Diabetes is commonly known as ‘having 

					sugar’ but is often accompanied by the metabolic syndrome which is defined as a cluster 

					of metabolic disorders like insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia (skewed lipid levels), high 

					cholesterol, high triglycerides, hypertension and obesity.

					‘Diabetes’ is a term that was first coined around 2nd

					ancient Greek physician, when very little was known of the remedy for this malaise. 

					He described it as: 
					<i>
					“…a dreadful affliction…a melting down of the flesh and limbs into urine. The 

					patients never stop making water and the flow is incessant…Life is short, unpleasant 

					and painful, thirst unquenchable, drinking excessive, and disproportionate to the 

					large quantity of urine, for yet more urine is passed….If for a while they abstain 

					from drinking, their mouths become parched and their bodies dry; the viscera seem 

					scorched up, the patients are affected by nausea, restlessness and a burning thirst, 

					and within a short time, they expire </i>

					</br>
					<h3>
						Why is India called diabetes capital of world? 
					</h3>

						Every 5th

						 diabetic patient in the world is an Indian.

						India has nearly 63 million people suffering from diabetes.


					<h3> Why this trend? </h3>

						In the last two decades, economic growth and affluence in India has brought forth 

						a vast variety of changes in lifestyle, which is primarily reﬂected in a nutritional 

						transition and a globalization of diet. On the other hand physical activity has 

						declined to a great extent.In the competitive world stress has increased in geometric 

						proportion. Asians, especially Indians, are genetically predisposed to diabetes, 

						hypertension and obesity. : Indians have more clustered fat in their bodies (as much 

						as 1.5 % more than white people) from birth onwards
					<h3> Worrying trends </h3>

						Diabetes seems to be affecting the younger population in the most productive years 

						of their life. There has been an alarming rise in the number of children being affected 

						by the so-called adult-onset or type-2 diabetes
