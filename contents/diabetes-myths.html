				<h1>Myths about diabetes</h1>

				<p>The term Diabetes comes from the Greek word for ‘siphon’, as people with diabetes urinate frequently. Diabetes Mellitus is also derived from a Greek word, meaning ‘sweet’, a reference to the presence of sugar in the urine. Diabetes is commonly known as ‘having sugar’ but is often accompanied by the metabolic syndrome which is defined as a cluster of metabolic disorders like insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia (skewed lipid levels), high cholesterol, high triglycerides, hypertension and obesity.</p>

				</br>
				
				<p>‘Diabetes’ is a term that was first coined around 2nd century AD, by Aretaeus, an ancient Greek physician, when very little was known of the remedy for this malaise. He described it as: 
					<i>“…a dreadful affliction…a melting down of the flesh and limbs into urine. The patients never stop making water and the flow is incessant…Life is short, unpleasant and painful, thirst unquenchable, drinking excessive, and disproportionate to the large quantity of urine, for yet more urine is passed….If for a while they abstain from drinking, their mouths become parched and their bodies dry; the viscera seem scorched up, the patients are affected by nausea, restlessness and a burning thirst, and within a short time, they expire </i>
				</p>

				<h2>Foods to be avoided</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Claims about complete cure of Diabetes</h3>
						<p>As of now, there is no CURE for diabetes. The blood sugar levels can be controlled with the help of lifestyle modification, drugs and insulin. The research on stem cell therapy for cure of diabetes are going on and have shown some promising results but till date it has not become standard of care.</p>				
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Can I stop medicines once sugar level has normalized?</h3>
						<p>NO. The sugar level is controlled because of medicines. The decision to stop or reduce medicines should be taken in consultation with treating physician.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>If my doctor starts insulin for me, it will continue for lifetime</h3>
						<p>It does not necessarily continue for lifetime. Insulin is the best treatment in certain conditions. If your physician advices insulin don’t hesitate to start it. Its very easy and can be done by oneself.</p>
